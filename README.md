# Heart Disease Prediction Project – Full Machine Learning Pipeline  

---

## Project Description
This project focuses on building a **comprehensive machine learning pipeline** to predict the presence of heart disease based on patient health records. It covers the **entire workflow**: from data preprocessing, dimensionality reduction, feature selection, supervised and unsupervised learning, model evaluation, optimization, to final deployment. The ultimate goal is to help identify patients at risk of heart disease through interpretable and efficient ML models.

##  Workflow Steps
1. **Data Preprocessing & Cleaning** – Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, scaled numerical features, and performed EDA.  
2. **Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)** – Reduced features while retaining most variance.  
3. **Feature Selection** – Used RFE, Chi-Square, and feature importance to keep relevant predictors.  
4. **Supervised Learning** – Trained Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and SVM.  
5. **Unsupervised Learning** – Applied K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering to detect patterns.  
6. **Model Evaluation** – Measured Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and AUC.  
7. **Hyperparameter Tuning** – Applied GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV for optimization.  
8. **Model Export & Deployment** – Saved final model using pickle.
