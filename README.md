# Heart_Disease_Project
The goal of this project is to build a comprehensive machine learning pipeline to predict the presence of heart disease. We started with raw data and followed all the key steps of a data science project: data cleaning, feature engineering, model train and  optimize. The final outcome is an optimized model capable of make high accurate predictions
#Key tools and technologies
Python: The main programming language used for the entire project.

Pandas & NumPy: Essential libraries for data manipulation, cleaning, and numerical operations. Pandas was used to handle the dataset, while NumPy provided support for arrays and mathematical functions.

Scikit-learn (Sklearn): The core library for building and evaluating machine learning models. We used various modules from Scikit-learn to perform:

Data Preprocessing: Scaling numerical features and encoding categorical ones.

Dimensionality Reduction: Using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to simplify the dataset.

Feature Selection: Applying Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and analyzing feature importance with Random Forest.

Supervised Learning: Training and evaluating classification models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVMs).

Unsupervised Learning: Performing clustering with K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing the best-performing model using GridSearchCV to find the ideal parameters.
