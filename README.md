# Heart_Disease_Project
The goal of this project is to build a comprehensive machine learning pipeline to predict the presence of heart disease. We started with raw data and followed all the key steps of a data science project: data cleaning, feature engineering, model train and  optimize. The final outcome is an optimized model capable of make high accurate predictions
